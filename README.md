# Sudoku Solver using React

This app reads in a selected (or random) sudoku puzzles from a predefined JSON file, and uses the "Backtracing" algorithm to generate a solution. The app is written in React, with CSS styling.

## Purpose of building this project

I want to continue teaching myself React. I believe that writing an app to solve a somewhat complex problem is a good way to learn how to code, as well as grow more confident in my problem solving skills.

## What did I learn

1. How to create a react app from the baseline `create-react-app` project.
2. Structuring the game logic into multiple functional components.
3. "Backtracing" (brute-force) algorithm for solving sudoku puzzles.
4. Separate styling into multiple files for each component.
5. Handling state across multiple React components, as well as in a game loop.
